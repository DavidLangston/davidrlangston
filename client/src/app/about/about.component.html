<div id="about">

    <p>In my spare time I enjoy reading nonfiction books, particularly about people. For example, I like reading about psychology, philosophy, and history.  But I also find subjects like biology, physics, math, and statistics interesting.  I enjoy learning new things in general.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:30px">I also like to walk.</p>
